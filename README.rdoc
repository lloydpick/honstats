= honstats

Ruby interface for Heroes of Newerth game's players statistics.

This branch (dev) is a complete rewrite, so expect new ways to request HoN's statistics.

== Code

* Github: http://github.com/lloydpick/honstats

== Getting Started

This is just a simple and very small example about what honstats can do:

  >> require 'honstats'
  >> HonStats::Character.find_by_nickname("foo").pub_skill
  => "1500"
