Returns an object which contains all the player statistics avaialable for
the user specified. You must specify a username rather than an account ID
for this to function correctly.

=== Examples

This will return all the player statistics for the player named "Limi"

    require 'honstats'
    honstats = HonStats::API.new
    char = honstats.get_character("Limi")
    char.class.to_s
    => HonStats::Classes::Character

If you were to call <tt>to_s</tt> or <tt>to_i</tt> to the <tt>char</tt> variable
you would get the character account name and account id respectively.

From there you can access inidividual statistics by sections...

    char.account.inspect
    char.building.inspect
    char.creep.inspect
    char.hero.inspect
    char.game.inspect
    char.lastmatch.inspect
    char.neutral.inspect

...or by querying them directly...

    char.hero.kills
    => 304
    char.creep.kills
    => 5329

Each individual section holds different statistics...
